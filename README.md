# Architecture NFT: FHE-Encrypted Blueprints for the Future üèóÔ∏èüîí

Architecture NFT empowers architects to mint FHE-encrypted architectural blueprints into NFTs, providing a revolutionary solution for protecting intellectual property. Utilizing **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**, this project ensures that while clients can view and interact with the designs they purchase, they cannot replicate them. By ingeniously combining blockchain technology with privacy measures, we pave the way for a new era in the architectural design industry.

## The Challenge of Intellectual Property Protection

In the competitive world of architecture, protecting original designs is a continual struggle. Traditional methods of sharing blueprints with clients often expose architects to the risk of unauthorized copying and exploitation. Once designs are out in the open, safeguarding them against misuse becomes nearly impossible. This raises concerns over intellectual property, unique design rights, and the overall trust in digital transactions. 

## Zama's FHE Solution

The solution lies in leveraging **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to offer a secure way of sharing architectural blueprints while preserving the architect's intellectual property. With Zama's open-source libraries such as **Concrete**, **TFHE-rs**, or the **zama-fhe SDK**, the NFT's underlying data remains encrypted, allowing only the purchaser to decrypt and utilize the blueprints. This not only protects the architect‚Äôs designs but also opens new pathways for monetization through confidential bidding processes or the digital asset trading market.

## Key Features

- **FHE-Encrypted Blueprints**: Architects can mint blueprints as NFTs, ensuring that their intellectual property is securely protected.
- **Ownership and Usage Rights**: The NFT represents not only ownership but also grants specified uses, preventing unauthorized reproduction.
- **Confidential Bidding Processes**: Clients can bid on designs without exposing sensitive information, enhancing privacy and trust in transactions.
- **3D Model Preview**: Users can view a 3D model representation of the blueprint directly on the NFT marketplace.
- **Decentralized NFT Marketplace**: The platform facilitates secure transactions while maintaining user privacy.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama SDK**: Core technology for implementing FHE capabilities.
- **Ethereum**: Smart contract platform for NFT transactions.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for executing the project‚Äôs backend.
- **Hardhat**: Development environment for Ethereum software.
- **IPFS**: Storage solution for hosting NFT metadata and assets.

## Installation Guide

To set up the Architecture NFT project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine. If not, please install the latest version from the official Node.js website.
2. Install **Hardhat** or **Foundry** as your development framework.
3. Download the project files and navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run the following command to install the required dependencies including Zama FHE libraries:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

**Important**: Please refrain from using `git clone` or any URLs.

## Build & Run Guide

After installation, follow these commands to compile, test, and deploy your project:

1. **Compile the smart contracts**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run tests to ensure everything functions correctly**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Mint a new Architecture NFT**:
   Create a new NFT by executing the mint script:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/mintNFT.js
   ```

4. **Deploy the contracts to the network**:
   This command will deploy your contracts on the specified Ethereum network:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your-network-name>
   ```

## Code Snippet Example

Here‚Äôs a simple code snippet demonstrating how to mint an NFT using FHE encryption:

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
const { FHE } = require("zama-fhe-sdk");

async function mintNFT(data) {
    const encryptedData = FHE.encrypt(data); // Encrypt the blueprint data
    const architectureNFT = await ethers.getContractAt("architectureNFT", contractAddress);
    
    const tx = await architectureNFT.mintNFT(encryptedData);
    await tx.wait();

    console.log(`NFT minted! Transaction Hash: ${tx.hash}`);
}

// Sample blueprint data to encrypt
const blueprintData = {
    architect: "Jane Doe",
    design: "Modern Eco-Friendly House",
};
mintNFT(blueprintData);
```
